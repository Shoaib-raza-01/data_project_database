# CAP

CAP refer to three desirable properties of distributed systems with replicated data: consistency (among replicated copies), availability (of the system for read and write operations) and partition tolerance (in the face of the nodes in the system being partitioned by a network fault). 

The CAP theorem states that it is not possible to guarantee all three of the desirable properties â€“ consistency, availability, and partition tolerance at the same time in a distributed system with data replication. 

The theorem states that networked shared-data systems can only strongly support two of the following three properties
