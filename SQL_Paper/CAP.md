# CAP

CAP refer to three desirable properties of distributed systems with replicated data: consistency (among replicated copies), availability (of the system for read and write operations) and partition tolerance (in the face of the nodes in the system being partitioned by a network fault). 

The CAP theorem states that it is not possible to guarantee all three of the desirable properties â€“ consistency, availability, and partition tolerance at the same time in a distributed system with data replication. 

The theorem states that networked shared-data systems can only strongly support two of the following three properties

**Consistency** 
* Consistency means that the nodes will have the same copies of a replicated data item visible for various transactions. A guarantee that every node in a distributed cluster returns the same, most recent and a successful write

**Availability**

* Availability means that each read or write request for a data item will either be processed successfully or will receive a message that the operation cannot be completed. Every non-failing node returns a response for all the read and write requests in a reasonable amount of time

**Partition Tolerance** 
* Partition tolerance means that the system can continue operating even if the network connecting the nodes has a fault that results in two or more partitions, where the nodes in each partition can only communicate among each other
